# Corporate-Branch-Network-

In this project, I have created a simulation for a corporate branch network. The branch has a DNS server, HTTP server, and a router.
The router is connected to two switches, the first switch is connected to the DNS and HTTP servers. The second switch is connected to APs which each department has, and
each AP has multiple hosts connected to it.
